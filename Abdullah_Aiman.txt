A pull request (PR) is a method used in version control systems, particularly in distributed version control systems like Git, to propose changes to a codebase. It is a way for developers to notify others about changes they have made in a branch in a repository. The primary purpose of a pull request is to merge changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch (such as master or main).
